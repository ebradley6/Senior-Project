Here's the folder for all the quartus project files Elisabeth has created. 

Versions:
Control Panel: the control panel example recompiled for quartus 15.1
Karaoke_15_1_v1_1: No control panel; volume control is set up; no fifo; audio in = audio out
Karaoke_15_1_v1_2: No control panel; fifo is set up, but as of 3/21 is not working correctly in hardware; 
                    when it is working correctly, audio out should equal the instrumental track
Karaoke_15_1_v1_3: Control panel; same set up as v1_2; Jason, let me know if Linux does not show up on the LCD screen
